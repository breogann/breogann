### Hi there 🙋‍♂️!

I am a **data analyst | python developer**. I work with ETL processes, data analysis and machine learning. Especially interested in automation and also speech processing & phonology—all of it through (mainly) `Python` and `bash`.

-  Sometimes I talk about things on [medium](https://medium.com/@fernandocostapradillo/starting-off-a-python-data-science-project-on-github-ec160fd97c63)
-  Currently working on **deployment** of my own projects.
-  Also learning about **postgres and pyspark**.
-  Ask me about anything! You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernandocostapradillo/)

On this page you may find both projects and educational content such as workshops.

These are the technologies I use:

| **Languages 🧑‍💻 | **Version control** 📆| **Databases** 🐬| **Deployment** ☁️ | **Visualization** 📊|
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Python | Git| SQL | Docker | Python: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly |
| Bash | | MongoDB | Heroku | Tableau
| SQL|  |  | Streamlit | PowerBI
